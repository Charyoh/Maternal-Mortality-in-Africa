## Project Overview
Maternal mortality is a significant public health concern in Africa. In 2023, there were 260,000 maternal fatalities globally, with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for 70%. Providing adequate healthcare access can avert many maternal fatalities. High mortality rates highlight inequities in healthcare systems.

#### We aimed to explore:​
The relationship between health spending and maternal mortality rates in African nations. 
​Supports SDG Goal 3 : Ensure healthy lives and promote well- being.
​SDG Target 3.1 Reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100 000 live births.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial preparation phase, we performed the following task:
1. Merged different datasets.  
2. Filtered the data to obtain only African Countries.
3. Handled missing values. 
4. Checked for duplicates and formatting

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the Maternal mortality data to answer key questions, such as:
- What region in Africa had the most mortality rate-MMR?

- Does the country's health expenditure directly affect MMR?

- What relationship does the countries with the highest and lowest MMR have?

## Results
This data indicates West Africa has the highest MMR while North Africa has the lowest MMR.
*Declining Trends*: Several countries show a reduction in maternal mortality over the years, reflecting the impact of targeted health investments.  
*Health Spending Gaps*: A moderate but positive correlation is observed between health expenditure and improved outcomes.  
*Regional Disparities*: Significant differences exist between countries, with some facing a lifetime maternal death risk as high as 1 in 20.

## Recommendations
1. Invest Smarter, Not Just More​
Focus on efficient, targeted spending that prioritizes maternal health services, especially in underserved communities. 
2. Strengthen Maternal Care Systems​
Expand access to skilled birth attendants, emergency obstetric care, and antenatal services—particularly in rural and high-risk areas. w
